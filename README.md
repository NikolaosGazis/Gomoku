# Gomoku 

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic board game Gomoku (Five in a Row) using the C programming language. Gomoku is a two-player game where the players take turns placing their pieces on a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a continuous horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five pieces.

## How to Play
Setup: The game board is initialized with a size of 15x15.

Game Loop: Players take turns placing their pieces (X for the player, O for the computer) on the board.

Winning Condition: The game detects a win if a player manages to form a chain of five consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Draw Condition: If the entire board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Play Again: After each game, the player has the option to play again or exit.
